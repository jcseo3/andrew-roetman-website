        <p>Ageless, generous eyes listen to laughter of children and grandparents</p>
        <p>Genderless, heartstrings resonate in gentle whispers dancing free of masks</p>
        <p>Colorless, wisdom and family welcome home like cool rain on hot skin</p>
        <p>Godless, many footfalls to the sun shrine only to see yourself, breathe, beautiful</p>
