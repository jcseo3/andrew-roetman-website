    <p>How I understand my roots will forever be informed by a moment memorialized in my imagination. I was sitting at my cousin’s dinner table in Tijarafe de La Palma, with my uncle Orlando, who journeyed from my abuela’s house in Humocaro Alto, Estado de Lara, Venezuela. My mom painstakingly organized a convoluted plan to have him leave their simple village, detour hours through the mountains around the security checkpoints of the occupying authoritarian regime, catch his first ever flight and meet us in neutral territory. I remember this evening vividly, the sunset spilling through the window dyeing the table cloth a radiant orange and glimmering off the tears on my uncle’s glasses. Spanish is not my native tongue so I asked tío if he could help me read a famous Venezuelan poem by Leoncio Martínez, “La Balada del Preso Insomne”, written in 1920 as the political prisoner of another one of Venezuela’s dictators.</p> 
<p>The poem describes a Venezuelan man who contemplates exiling himself in America, a strange land where he might enjoy the freedoms he was denied. He talks about speaking the foreign language, badly, savoring exotic flavors, remembering the family he lost and imagining who his grandchildren might become. My uncle, who wears the scars of regime change with the most resilient smile in my memory, shed the same silent tears I share today. Maybe the grandchildren will somewhat resemble their grandfather, with skin and spirit born of a new world, but, as the youth jot down the dates of their ancestor’s birth and death, the line that weighs on both our hearts reads:</p>

   <i>
<p>“El abuelo no era de aquí,</p>
<p>El abuelo era un exiliado,</p>
<p>El abuelo era un infeliz,</p>
<p>El abuelo no tuvo patria,</p>
<p>No tuvo patria…”¡Y ellos sí!</p>
</i>

This is the story of my mother, Carmen Pastora Colmenarez de Garcia, like so many immigrants from Latin America who came to the U.S. seeking a better life for their children, and the story of her only child. Unbeknownst to anyone at the time, a cruel disease was festering in her mind. Within the year, her brain deteriorated and she forgot the people who loved her until even my face became a stranger in her eyes. As detestable as it was, not even dementia could pry the precious jewel that is her country from her grip.

When my mother gave her last breath to this “strange land,” to borrow Martínez’s imagery, I inherited the reflection of a ruby. Surrounded by treasures of many kinds except those familiar to my blood, with a palette seasoned by Trader Joe’s black beans and jasmine rice, I am desperate and determined to learn the alchemical formula for turning the reflection, concrete. Being Latinx in 2020 means being separated from my family by death and dictatorship, only able to talk when the rolling blackouts in the village permit us, and accepting tragedy with authentic, hearty laughter as we pray for the day when we will see each other tomorrow.
